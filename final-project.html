      <p>I wanted to build a device for your candle that reminds you to put it out candle and tells you when it is fully cooled down so you can put it away. I used a red and a green led, a buzzer and a thermistor. The thermistor is to know whether the candle is lit and when it is cool. I calibrated by lighting the candle and fully cooling it in order to find the thermistor values necessary for my code. I chose to do both a visual and an audio cue to ensure that users would know when to take action.</p>

      <p>I used this small breadboard and just stacked it on top of my arduino to make it more compact. The LEDs and thermistor needed to be visible on the outside of the box, so I poked holes in the box and inserted those components. The back of the box got a panel with a small hole in it for the cable to come through. If I was to do this again, I probably would have done a battery so it could be self contained. There was more space than I thought there was going to be in the enclosed section.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The thermistor is positioned on the center part so that the candle could push up against if fully. When it reads 650 or higher, or when the top of the candle is fully melted, it will begin tracking time. It is set to 2 hours, but it would be fun in future iterations to make this adjustable. It would require some other input method though. After 2 hours, the red LED will light up and the buzzer will start going off. It'll keep going off until the candle begins to cool off, which is generally not immediately after it has been extinguished due to the residual heat. The temperature will continue to drop and when it hits 550, or where the candle is cool to touch and ready to put away. At that point, the green LED will light up and it will buzz once.</p>
