      <p>I chose to do a single green led and the white led. The green one was set up similarly to how I've done it in the past and the white led was set up so that each color had it's own PWM pin. I also included a button. Resistors for each color led was calculated as seen. The first row is for the red and greens and the second row is for blue. I used a resistor for the button to ensure that the current is not too high after the button is released. 10K is much higher than necessary, but does not prevent the button from working.</p>

      <p>From left to right, button, white led and then green. The white led fades from fully off to fully on. When the button is pressed, it'll turn off and the green will turn on.</p>

          I assumed that the button would be pressed half the time. It would run for 52.887 hrs.
