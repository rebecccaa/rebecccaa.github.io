      <p>I decided to use the white led, photosensor and IR receiver. The LED is connected to PWM pins to control the brightness of each color. Resistors are 255 for red and green and 100 for blue. See A2 for calculations. The photosensor has a pull down resistor of 10K ohms, which is much higher than necessary but doesn't prevent the sensor from working.</p>

      <p>Using the top 6 buttons on the IR remote allows you to control the color values. It starts at 255 and you can decrease or increase the value of the red, green and blue. The alpha value for transparency is controlled by the photosensor. It is mapped to 0 to 255 and was able to read nearly that whole range. The lowest value observed was around 10 and the highest 235. The LED on off state is controlled by the mouse placement and the color is controlled by the IR receiver.</p>
